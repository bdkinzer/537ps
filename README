This is a simplified version of the linux ps command, options include:

-p <pid>
Display process information only for the process whose number is pid. It does not matter if the specified process is owned by the current user. If this option is not present then display information for all processes of the current user (and only of the current user).
-s
Display the single-character state information about the process. This information is found in the stat file in process's directory, looking at the third ("state") field. Note that the information that you read from the stat file is a character string. This option defaults to be false, so if it is not present, do not display this information. -s- is valid but has no effect.
-U
Display the amount of user time consumed by this process. This information is found in the stat file in process's directory, looking at the "utime" field. This option defaults to be true, so if it is not present, then this information is displayed. -U- turns this option off.
-S
Display the amount of system time consumed so far by this process. This information is found in the stat file in process's directory, looking at the "stime" field. This option defaults to be false, so if it is not present, then this information is not displayed. -S- is valid but has no effect.
-v
Display the amount of virtual memory currently being used (in pages) by this program. This information is found in the statm file in process's directory, looking at first ("size") field. This option defaults to be false, so if it is not present, then this information is not displayed. -v- is valid but has no effect.
-c
Display the command-line that started this program. This information is found in the cmdline file in process's directory. Be careful on this one, because this file contains a list of null (zero byte) terminated strings. This option defaults to be true, so if it is not present, then this information is displayed. -c- turns this option off.

We created four modules. options_processing parses the command line and changes some flags in an array
depending on which options are present. process_list reads the -p flag to see which process' information 
should be retrieved and first tallies the number of processes. stat_file_parser then goes into stat and 
statm to retrieve the information specified by the user. Main calls options_processing, sends this info
if needed to process_list, then for each process, calls stat_file_parser once.
